We focus on the evaluation results of agglomerative method. The results show the values of DBI and SIL under different input, linkage function and preset number of clusters. 
Furthermore, we choose one of clustering results as visualization example when considering 2D, 3D principal components and LAB components from spectra as input and average linkage, 8 clusters as parameters.
