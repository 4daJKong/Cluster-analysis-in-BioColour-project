# Cluster-analysis-in-BioColour-project
we apply common unsupervised learning methods to discover hidden clusters emerging among bio-dyed textile samples, and show the potential of clustering techniques in this application domain. 

In detail, we use agglomerative clustering, Fuzzy C-means, OPTICS as well as a well-known artificial neural network (ANN), namely self-organizing maps (SOM), resulting in an investigation that combines data visualization and cluster analysis.
